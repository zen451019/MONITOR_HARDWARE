# Circuit Schema

The schematic design of the system is carried out using the KICAD electronic design platform, version 9.0. This specialized software allows for the detailed and accurate creation of electrical and electronic diagrams, facilitating the graphical representation of components and their interconnections within the system. As a result of this process, a complete and structured schematic is obtained.
